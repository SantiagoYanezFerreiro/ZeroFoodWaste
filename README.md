Zero Food Waste is a non-profit association whose mission is to contribute to reducing Global Food Waste. 

For this purpose 1) it allows companies like restaurants and supermarkets that want to donate food to get in touch through it with charities and other organisations that could use this food. 
2) offers information and a newsletter to raise awareness about this problem and inform users about related events.

The website provides general statistics and information about Worldwide Food Waste and their future predictions and a quiz to keep users engaged while learning. Also uses the Google Maps API to display the countries that waste the most food globally. 
About Us Page contains info about the company; its history, mission & values and their current & future actions to fight this problem.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The two main colours used are White and Green. Black is also a common complementary color, which was mainly chosen for buttons. 

### Typography

The Lato font is the main font of the website with Arial and sans-seriff as fallback. I opted for Lato because it's a sans-seriff that looks stylish and is easy to read.

### Imagery

I used a lot of Food Waste/Food Images, mainly to make the website look better and as background for the content.

### Modifications from the Original Wireframes

• I thought it was better to include the general information about the company like its mission, history and so on in a separate section called about us.
This way it won't deviate the attention of visitors from the main purposes of the page and the website will be better structured.


• Prefered to create a quiz that starts after pressing a button instead of ocupying a lot of space by displaying all questions on the quiz starting page vertically.
I think it looks way better and visitors only see the most relevant part of the quiz for them for the moment.


• I though it was better to include info about the company partners in the about page instead of in the contact page.

## Issues & Problems found during Testing

#### Further Testing

• The Site was tested on Google Chrome, Explorer, Opera and Microsoft Edge.

• The website was also checked on desktop, tablets and several phone devices (Iphone, Xiaomi, Xperia).

• All links were double checked to ensure they work as desired.

• Friends were also asked to check the website and give feedback about the site and any errors when found.


#### Known Bugs  & Problems 
• It took me a while to format properly the containers. These two pages also didn't look too good until I implemented a parallax effect.

• The partners images in the about section didn't look too good initially since I just placed the images with the src. Improved a lof by setting them as a background image.

• EmailJS was not working in the beginning and took me a while to configure it and discover since there were minor mistakes in the code and wasn't used to the API.

• I also needed time and a lot of internet searches to make the Maps API work displaying the information correctly for each country.
