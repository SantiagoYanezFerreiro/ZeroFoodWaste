## Design

### Colour Scheme

The two main colours used are White and Green.

### Typography

The Lato font is the main font of the website with Arial and sans-seriff as fallback. I opted for Lato because it's a sans-seriff that looks stylish and is easy to read.

### Imagery

I used a lot of Food Waste/Food Images, mainly to make the website look better and as background for the content.
